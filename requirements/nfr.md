# Non-Functional Requirements: Jira Search

## 1. Performance

### Latency Requirements
- **Search Response Time**: < 500ms for queries against datasets up to 50,000 issues at p95
- **Type-ahead Suggestions**: < 100ms response time for autocomplete queries
- **Page Load Time**: Initial application load < 2 seconds on standard broadband
- **Issue Preview Modal**: < 200ms to display cached issue details
- **Sync Operations**: Should not impact search performance (background processing)

### Load Requirements
- **Database Operations**: SQLite FTS5 queries must complete within allocated time budgets
- **Memory Usage**: Application should not exceed 512MB RAM under normal operations

### Performance Targets by Dataset Size
- **< 10k issues**: All operations under 100ms
- **10k - 50k issues**: Search under 500ms, sync under 5 minutes
- **50k+ issues**: Search under 1s, chunked sync with progress tracking

## 2. Scalability

### Data Growth Assumptions
- **Issue Volume**: Designed to handle up to 100,000 issues per project over 2 years
- **Custom Fields**: Support up to 50 additional custom fields without performance impact
- **Comment Volume**: Handle issues with 100+ comments efficiently
- **Attachment Metadata**: Store attachment references without downloading content

### Database Design for Scale
- **Denormalized Schema**: Optimize for read performance over storage efficiency
- **FTS5 Indexing**: Full-text search indexes on summary, description, and combined comments
- **Enum Storage**: Use integer enums for priority, status, and other categorical fields
- **Batch Processing**: Sync operations process issues in configurable batches (default: 100)

### Resource Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Single-user deployment model (no shared database requirements)
- **Storage Growth**: Plan for 1GB local storage per 50,000 issues with full content
- **Network Bandwidth**: Configurable rate limiting (default: 100 requests/minute to Jira)

## 3. Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Personal Access Token Storage**: Store in config file, no special encryption needed
- **Token Validation**: Validate PAT permissions before initial sync

### Vulnerability Management
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs including search queries and configuration
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing internal system details in error messages

## 4. Accessibility (a11y)

### Compliance Level
- **Standard**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for web interface
- **Priority**: Focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for search-heavy workflows

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Search Interface**: Full keyboard navigation for search box, filters, and results
- **Modal Dialogs**: Trap focus within issue preview modals
- **Bulk Selection**: Keyboard shortcuts for select all, clear selection
- **Tab Order**: Logical tab sequence through all interactive elements

### Visual Design
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **Text Scaling**: Support browser zoom up to 200% without horizontal scrolling

## 5. Observability

### Logging Requirements
- **Application Logs**: Structured logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- **Sync Operations**: Log sync start/completion, issue counts, and any failures
- **Search Performance**: Log slow queries (>1 second) with query details
- **Authentication Events**: Log successful/failed authentication attempts
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logs with stack traces for debugging

### Key Events to Track
- `user_search_performed` - Search query, result count, response time
- `jira_sync_started` - Sync type (full/incremental), timestamp
- `jira_sync_completed` - Duration, issues processed, issues updated
- `jira_api_error` - Error type, HTTP status, retry count
- `bulk_action_initiated` - Issue count, action type
- `database_query_slow` - Query type, duration, record count

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Search Performance Dashboard**: Query response times
- **Sync Health Dashboard**: Success rates, sync durations, API error rates
- **System Resource Usage**: Database size, memory usage, disk I/O

### Health Checks
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure all required settings are properly configured

### Performance Monitoring
- **Database Query Analysis**: Track slow queries and index usage
- **User Experience Metrics**: Measure time-to-first-search and search satisfaction
