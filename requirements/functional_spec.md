# Functional Specification: Jira Search

## 1. Detailed User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: Initial Jira Connection and Sync

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to configure the app to connect to my Jira instance so that I can begin syncing issue data locally.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: First-time setup with valid credentials**
- Given I am a new user with a sample config.yaml.example file
- And I have valid Jira Data Center credentials (URL, username, PAT)
- When I enter my Jira instance URL, username, and Personal Access Token to the config.yaml
- And I specify a project key or JQL query for initial sync
- Then the system validates the connection successfully
- And the system begins initial sync of all matching issues
- And I see a progress indicator showing sync status

**Scenario: Configuration with custom fields**
- Given I have successfully connected to Jira
- When I access the configuration panel
- And I specify additional custom fields to sync (field ID and display name) in the config.yaml file
- Then the system includes these fields in subsequent syncs
- And the custom fields become searchable in the UI

### User Story 2: Fast Local Search with Type-ahead

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to search issues using natural language with instant feedback so that I can quickly find relevant work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: Type-ahead search with natural language**
- Given I have synced issues in the local database
- When I start typing in the search box after 2+ characters
- Then I see type-ahead suggestions within 100ms
- And suggestions include issue keys, summaries, and assignee names
- And I can navigate suggestions using keyboard arrows

**Scenario: Full-text search across issue content**
- Given I have entered a search term like "user authentication bug"
- When I press Enter or click search
- Then I see results ranked by relevance within 500ms
- And results include matches in summary, description, and comments
- And matching text is highlighted in the results

### User Story 3: Advanced Search with JQL and Regex

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to use JQL syntax and regex patterns so that I can perform sophisticated queries beyond basic text search.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: JQL query execution**
- Given I want to find issues using JQL syntax
- When I enter a query like "assignee = currentUser() AND status = 'In Progress'"
- Then the system parses and executes the JQL against local data
- And results match what I would see in Jira for the same query
- And the query is validated for syntax errors before execution

**Scenario: Regex pattern search**
- Given I want to find issues with specific patterns
- When I enter a regex search like "summary ~ 'EPIC-\d{3}.*integration'"
- Then the system applies the regex pattern to relevant fields
- And results include only issues matching the pattern
- And invalid regex patterns show helpful error messages

### User Story 4: Issue Preview and Context

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to preview issue details without leaving the search interface so that I can quickly assess relevance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: Issue preview modal**
- Given I have search results displayed
- When I click on an issue key or summary
- Then a modal opens showing full issue details
- And the modal includes summary, description, comments, assignee, and status
- And custom fields are displayed if configured
- And I can navigate between issues in the modal using keyboard shortcuts

**Scenario: External Jira link**
- Given I am viewing an issue preview
- When I click "Open in Jira"
- Then a new tab opens to the issue in the Jira web interface
- And the URL includes proper authentication context

### User Story 5: Bulk Action Selection

**User Story:** As a tech lead, I want to select multiple search results and initiate bulk actions so that I can efficiently manage issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: Multi-select search results**
- Given I have search results displayed
- When I check the checkbox next to multiple issues
- Then selected issues are visually highlighted
- And a bulk action toolbar appears showing the count of selected items
- And I can select/deselect all results with a master checkbox

**Scenario: Bulk edit in Jira**
- Given I have selected multiple issues
- When I click "Bulk Edit in Jira"
- Then a new tab opens to Jira's bulk edit interface
- And all selected issues are pre-populated in the bulk edit form
- And I can proceed with bulk operations in Jira's native interface

### User Story 6: Incremental Sync and Data Freshness

**User Story:** As a team member, I want issue data to stay current with Jira automatically so that my searches reflect the latest state.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Scenario: Manual sync trigger**
- Given I want to ensure I have the latest data
- When I run the sync command on CLI
- Then an incremental sync begins immediately
- And I see a progress indicator
- And search remains available during sync (on existing data)

## 2. Edge Cases & Error States

### Empty States
- **No issues found**: Display helpful message suggesting search refinement or sync status check
- **No search results**: Provide suggestions for alternative search terms

### Rate Limiting and API Errors
- **Jira rate limit exceeded**: Pause sync operations and retry with exponential backoff
- **Network connectivity issues**: Queue sync operations and retry when connection restored
- **Jira server unavailable**: Display last successful sync timestamp and continue with cached data

### Data Consistency
- **Sync failure mid-process**: Log failure point and resume from last successful batch
- **Corrupted local database**: Offer full re-sync option with progress tracking
- **Large dataset sync timeout**: Implement chunked sync with progress preservation

### Search Performance
- **Query too broad (>10k results)**: Suggest search refinement and show first 1000 results
- **Complex regex timeout**: Abort query after 5 seconds with timeout message
- **Database lock contention**: Queue search requests during active sync operations

### Error Messages (User-Facing, on the CLI)
- **Connection Error**: "Unable to connect to Jira. Please check your server URL and network connection."
- **Authentication Error**: "Authentication failed. Please verify your username and Personal Access Token."
- **Sync Error**: "Sync incomplete due to server issues. Last successful sync: [timestamp]. Run again to retry."

## 3. UI/UX Flow (Text-Based)

### Main Search Interface
1. **Landing Page**: Clean, Google-like interface with prominent search box
2. **Search Box**: Large input field with placeholder text "Search issues... (supports JQL, regex, and natural language)"
3. **Search Mode Toggle**: Buttons for "Natural Language", "JQL", and "Regex" modes
4. **Quick Filters**: Common filters like "My Issues", "Recent", "Open Issues" as clickable chips
5. **Advanced Options**: Collapsible panel for date ranges, custom field filters, and result sorting

### Search Results
1. **Results List**: Issue key, summary, assignee, status, and last updated in card format
2. **Result Count**: "Showing X of Y results" with performance timing
3. **Bulk Actions**: Checkbox selection with bulk action toolbar
4. **Pagination**: Load more results on scroll (infinite scroll)
5. **Sort Options**: Dropdown for relevance, updated date, priority, etc.

### Issue Preview Modal

2. **Content**: Full summary, description with formatting preserved
3. **Metadata**: Created/updated dates, reporter, priority, components
4. **Comments**: Chronological list of comments with authors and timestamps
