# Product Requirements Document: Jira Search

## 1. Problem Statement

**User:** Software development teams, product managers, and technical leads who work extensively with Jira issues across medium to large projects.

**Problem:** Jira's native search interface is slow, limited, and frustrating for power users. JQL is powerful but has a steep learning curve and doesn't support advanced text search patterns like regex. Teams waste significant time navigating Jira's clunky UI to find relevant issues, especially when working across large backlogs or performing bulk operations.

**Why:** This problem is worth solving now because:
- Development teams spend 15-20% of their time searching for and organizing issues
- Jira's performance degrades significantly with large datasets (10k+ issues)
- Power users need regex, full-text search, and bulk operations that Jira doesn't provide efficiently
- Local search eliminates network latency and allows for offline work

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

**Product Goals:**
- Users can find any issue in under 1 seconds using natural language, JQL, or regex
- Users can perform bulk actions on search results without navigating back to Jira repeatedly
- Users can work with Jira data offline or with minimal network dependency

**Business Goals:**
- Reduce time spent on issue management by 40% for heavy Jira users
- Enable teams to adopt more sophisticated project tracking workflows
- Position as a productivity multiplier for development teams

**Success Metrics:**
- `avg_search_response_time` < 500ms for queries across 50k+ issues

## 3. Core User Stories (Jobs-to-be-Done)

1. **As a developer**, I want to quickly search across all project issues using natural language so that I can find related work without memorizing JQL syntax.

2. **As a product manager**, I want to use regex patterns to find issues with specific naming conventions so that I can audit and bulk-update issue organization.

3. **As a tech lead**, I want to select multiple search results and bulk-edit them in Jira so that I can efficiently manage sprint planning and issue triage.

4. **As a team member**, I want the local issue data to stay synchronized with Jira automatically so that I'm always working with current information.

5. **As a power user**, I want to integrate this search with my existing tools via API so that I can build custom workflows and automations.

6. **As a Jira expert**, I want to be able to use JQL within the search field.

## 4. Scope

**IN SCOPE:**
- Full and incremental sync with Jira Data Center using Personal Access Tokens
- Local SQLite database optimized for full-text search (FTS5)
- Single-page web UI with advanced search capabilities (natural language, JQL, regex)
- Type-ahead search suggestions and real-time filtering
- Issue preview functionality
- Bulk action initiation (opens Jira bulk edit with selected issues)
- REST API for external tool integration
- Configurable custom field synchronization
- Rate limiting and respectful API usage patterns

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Direct issue editing (users will use Jira's bulk edit interface)
- Multi-project sync in v1 (single project or JQL query scope)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Issue creation functionality
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Integration with other issue tracking systems (GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.)
- Advanced reporting or analytics beyond search
