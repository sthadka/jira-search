- **Performance Validation**: Measure search times at each phase, target <1s consistently
- **User Feedback**: Get feedback after Phases 3, 5, and 7 for UX validation
- **Technical Debt**: Plan refactoring time between Phases 7-8 to clean up quick implementations
- **Documentation**: Update docs continuously, don't leave it all for Phase 10
- **Commit to git**: Auto-commit to git after each sub-phase using "semantic release" commit message style
